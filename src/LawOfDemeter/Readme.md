# [The Law of Demeter](https://betterprogramming.pub/demeters-law-don-t-talk-to-strangers-87bb4af11694)

The Law of Demeter, also known as the Principle of Least Knowledge or Principle of Encapsulation, is a design principle that emphasizes loose coupling between objects. Its main idea is that an object should have limited knowledge about the internal structure of other objects and should only interact with its immediate "friends."

By following the Law of Demeter, developers can create more maintainable and flexible code by reducing the interdependence between objects and improving encapsulation. This principle encourages a more modular and decoupled design, leading to code that is easier to understand, modify, and test.
