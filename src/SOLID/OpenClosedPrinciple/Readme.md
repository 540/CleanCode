# Open-Closed Principle

Open-Closed Principle (OCP): It is a guideline for the overall design of classes and interfaces and how developers 
can build code that allows change over time. By ensuring that your code is open to 
extension but closed to modification, you disallow future changes to existing classes 
and assemblies, which forces programmers to create new classes that can plug into the extension points.

## Error case

In the BranchOffice we have more than one kind of employee, one class for each kind so we broke OCP

Can you fix it??
